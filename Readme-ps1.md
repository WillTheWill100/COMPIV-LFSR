## Description
A Linear Feedback Shift Register that takes the last bit and XOr it with the 13, 12, 10 and shifts all bits left by1 and insert the newly tapped bit into first bit

### Features
Boost test to test code funtioality
Step to get the next bit
Generate simulate step and returns a int that represents the generated bit

### Issues
Linting problems but thats it. Maybe weak tests

### Tests
test both step and generate funticality
test if step produces the right states
test if step returns the intended bits

### Extra Credit
none
